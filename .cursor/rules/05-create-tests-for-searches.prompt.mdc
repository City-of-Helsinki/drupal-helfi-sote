** GOAL **
The goal is to create Playwright tests for the following searches and place the files under tests/e2e:
- Maternity and child health clinic search
- Health station search
Do a separate test file per search.

--

## References
- It's paramount that you find the right test plan PER feature under e2e/generated_plan/plans! The plans are named like <feature_name>.test_plan.md .
Base the tests only to the tests described in the test plan for the given feature that you are creating the tests for.
- For the locators, use e2e/generated_plan/locators/<feature_name>.locators.md .

You can use these resources (including but limited to) for figuring out the tests:
- The found test_plan file from e2e/generated_plan/plans.
- The found locators file from e2e/generated_plan/locators.
- The codebase
- The actual feature with Playwright MCP. The base URL is https://www.hel.fi/fi/sosiaali-ja-terveyspalvelut and the path may be found from the test plan file.

## Things to note when creating the tests
- There is a modal "Auta meit채 parantamaan verkkosivujamme!", which may pop up. You can click the button "En osallistu kyselyyn" to disregard the modal.
- There is a cookie banner with a heading "Ev채steet hel.fi-sivustolla" popping up on the site. Please click "Hyv채ksy kaikki ev채steet" to allow the cookies.
- Disregard ALL performance related tests.
- Only create tests for one browser.
- You may create shared and individual helper files for separating the helper functionalities from the test code.
- When handling things like results, take into account Finnish singular and plural forms. For example 'paikka' being singluar, 'paikkaa' being plural.
- Use the generated locators!

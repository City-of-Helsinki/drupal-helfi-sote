** GOAL **
Find out, what is unique about the current site's (SOTE) configurations compared to other sites. Save the difference to config_analysis/sote_unique.md

---

## Instructions on how to do the diff
All of the config analysis files are from the different sites that have a very shared config base and codebase, which makes them similar in many aspects.
Based on the other config analyses from the different sites, create a diff, what is unique for the current site.
The goal is NOT to find unique items from other sites, only from SOTE.

---

## Resources
Use the configurations stored into config_analysis folder.
- config_analysis/drupal_config_analysis.md is for the main site (SOTE)
- config_analysis/drupal_config_analysis.<site>.md files are for the other sites.

--

## Output
Use the similar format to drupal_config_analysis.md for showing the differences.

** GOAL **
Find out, what is unique about the current site's (SOTE) configurations compared to other sites. Save the difference to config_analysis/sote_unique.md

---

## Instructions on how to do the diff
All of the config analysis files are from the different sites that have a very shared config base and codebase, which makes them similar in many aspects.
Based on the other config analyses from the different sites, create a diff, what is unique for the current site.
The goal is NOT to find unique items from other sites, only from SOTE. Analyse what kind of features the unique configuration entities form.

---

## Resources
Use the configurations stored into config_analysis folder.
- config_analysis/drupal_config_analysis.md is for the main site (SOTE)
- config_analysis/drupal_config_analysis.<site>.md files are for the other sites.

--

## Output
Create two sections in the output report file.
1. Create a list of features you analysed, which the configuration entities form. Please use the following format that includes both the information about the feature as well as the configuration entities that form it:
```

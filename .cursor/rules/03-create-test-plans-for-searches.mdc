** GOAL **
Generate testing plans for each search feature listed in the [feature_list.md](mdc:tests/e2e/generated_plan/feature_list.md). Save each plan into separate a file under tests/e2e/generated_plan/plans . Use the naming convention like <snake_case_name_of_the_feature>.test_plan.md for example interesting_search_feature.test_plan.md .

---

## Resources:
You can use these resources (including but limited to) for figuring out the testing:
- The codebase
- [drupal_config_analysis.md](mdc:config_analysis/drupal_config_analysis.md) for understanding what's in the Drupal config.
- Playwright MCP

---

## Gather information how the feature is being implemented to the site.
- Analyse how the feature is being implemented to the site. Find out if it's a paragraph, a block or something else.
- Also find out the page under which it's being used. Find at least one page where the search is being used.

---

## Plan creation.
Analayse the parts of the feature that the test plan is being created for. Try to find different test cases that cover the different functionalities of the feature. Do NOT analyse for performance. When analysing the page itself, try to isolate the function from the other page elements.

** GOAL **
Generate a list of features of the site/codebase. The feature list will be used as a basis of the Playwright test plan/suite. Write the plan to tests/e2e/generated_plan/feature_list.md.

## Resoruces
Here are the resources you can use in a prioritised (first one being the most important) list:
- Use mainly the file: [drupal_config_analysis.md](mdc:config_analysis/drupal_config_analysis.md) . From this file, find out different features on the site that should be part of the testing plan for playwright tests.
- You can also use the codebase in general, especially public/modules/contrib and public/modules/custom for Drupal modules.
- You can also use the Playwright MCP with the base URL of https://www.hel.fi/fi/sosiaali-ja-terveyspalvelut to verify the functionalities in practise.

## Feature list structure
- Divide the features between special features (for example: searches, integrations and other elements that require more code to function) and normal Drupal features (for example: navigations, content types, etc) .
- Emphasise on the special features.
